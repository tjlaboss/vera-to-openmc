# vera_xml
Read VERAin's xml.gold files and export them in the XML format of either OpenMC or OpenCG. I haven't yet decided what direction this project will take.

Contains the files:

#### `read_xml.py`:
Under active development. Describes the class Case, which should contain all of the information present in the XML of a VERA case.

#### `objects.py`:
Module containing useful classes for `read_xml.py`
